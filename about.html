                    Hi, My Name is Jatin Jindal and I get paid to solve problems related to human psychology. 
                    <br><br>

I help companies design products that will let their customers get the job done quickly and effectively, which in turn gives more business.
                    <br><br>
With over 2+ years of experience working on multiple products in different industries, I understood what not to do more than what not to do to make a product successful. If you are working on something exciting and want to discuss how wecan build it? let's connect.
